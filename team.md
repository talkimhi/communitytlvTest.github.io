	<div><h3><span style="color: burlywood">DevOps Ignites</span></h3></div>
	<div>
		<div class="box"><h4>Pregnancy - Nature's CI/CD
		<span style="color: burlywood">// Julia Shub</span></h4>
		<p>So you and your partner decide to have a child.<br>
From this point onwards, you can treat it as a CICD project since it's basically the same.</p>
	</div></div>
		<div class="box"><h4>Waste-Oriented, Hunch-Based Web Architecture
		<span style="color: burlywood">// Michael Zion</span></h4>
		<p>"The software engineering field lacks hunch-based decisions.<br>
It's oriented towards making things right, rather than going YOLO and enjoying life. <br>
In my talk I'm suggesting an alternate approach, where production is important, but not as much as the feelings of the person changing production."</p>
	</div></div>
		<div class="box"><h4>Obviously a major malfunction... Lessons 35 years after the Challenger Disaster
		<span style="color: burlywood">// Robert Barron</span></h4>
		<p>"The Space Shuttle was the most advanced machine ever designed. It was a triumph and a marvel of the modern world.<br>
And on January 1986, shuttle Challenger disintegrated seconds after launch.This session will discuss how and why the disaster occurred and what lessons modern DevOps and SREs can learn."</p>
	</div></div>
		<div class="box"><h4>Resilience Engineering - a Primer
		<span style="color: burlywood">// Anton Weiss</span></h4>
		<p>Lately we've heard some buzz around the term "resilience engineering" in relation to information systems.  Much of it initiated by none other but John Allspaw - the man who inspired the birth of DevOps. My talk will lay out how the ideas of resilience engineering relate to our daily work.</p>
	</div></div>
		<div class="box"><h4>Checking the pulse on DevOps and Observability
		<span style="color: burlywood">// Dotan Horovits</span></h4>
		<p>"What are the biggest obstacles to Observability? IsÂ Observability just the DevOps' responsibility? How many companies actually use tracing? Which open source SW is gaining popularity? <br>
We went and asked this and much more to nearly 1000 engineers across the globe, to check the pulse on DevOps."</p>
	</div></div>
		<div class="box"><h4>The Devil's DevOps
		<span style="color: burlywood">// Heidi Waterhouse</span></h4>
		<p>An Ignite that plays off Ambrose Bierce's The Devil's Dictionary to present satirical and painfully true definitions of words you hear at conferences all the time.</p>
	</div></div>
		<div class="box"><h4>Monitoring People - An Engineering approach to understanding human KPIs <span style="color: burlywood">// Erik Zaadi</span></h4>
		<p>Feel like understanding systems is easier and more logical than people?
Let's challenge that and see how engineering practices such as monitoring and CI can be correlated to understanding and improving humans, you know, those illogical chaotic beings, which are sooooo much different than production.</p>
