	<p>These events are all volunteer-led, by a dedicated team of passionate community builders, looking to bring people together for knowledge sharing, problem solving, learning, and the fun of networking and meeting new people.  We all have day jobs, and chop wood and carry water in our spare time to be able to make this happen. We're always looking for more volunteers, so <a href="#contact">reach out</a> if you are interested in joining us.</p>
