        <h4>KEYNOTE: THE WORLD HAS CHANGED - HAVE OUR DESIGNS?</h4>
        <div>ABSTRACT</div>
        <div><small>When we build systems our design and tradeoffs reflect the different scales of the system: the speed of disks, latency of network; They reflect the constraints and abilities of the underlying technologies. But as technology advances some of these assumptions have become invalid. We are no longer running on physical machines for which RDBMS systems were designed; SSD changed pretty much everything in the storage world, but our software was designed for magnetic disks; NVRAM? O/S design is way off. This talk will show how changes in hardware technologies impact design rational of various systems, highlighting the importance of understanding and rethinking the design rational and explore new designs that arise from the new rational.</small></div>

        <div>IGNITE</div>
        <div><small>There are many opinions on DevOps, open source, and cloud-native tech, but what is actually being practiced? What can we learn from the collective experience of the community? We went and surveyed over 1000 engineers across the globe about their DevOps practices, challenges, and more, with special focus on cloud native and observability. This session will share data and insights from the survey, with key trends (compared to previous years’ DevOps Pulse surveys), points of interest, and challenges that developers experience on a daily basis. This session will help you learn from the collective experience and emerging best practices in the community, to help guide decisions on processes, tooling and architecture choices.</small></div>

I love working with others to leverage experience and best practices to avoid common mistakes, and I’m captivated by novel ideas and technologies that try to make sense of the ever-increasing complexity of our world.

        <div><small>The Challenger launched for the last time on January 28th, 1986. It never reached orbit. The Challenger disaster was not only a failure of the technology, but a failure of the engineering and management culture in NASA. While engineers were aware of problems in the technology stack, there was no conception of the risks they actually posed to the spacecraft. Management had shifted the focus from “prove that it’s safe to launch” to “prove that it’s unsafe to stop the launch”. This session will present the risk analysis (or lack thereof) of the Shuttle program and draw parallels to modern software development. In the end, launching a shuttle is an extremely complex deployment to the cloud… and above it.</small></div>

        <div><small>With standard Kubernetes networking, connectivity is limited to a single cluster only, requiring proxies to connect workloads across clusters for migration, disaster-recovery, or geographic locality. Submariner is an open source project that enables high-performance cross-cluster connectivity and Service Discovery between different Kubernetes clusters, either on-premises or in the cloud. With Submariner, your applications and services can span multiple cloud providers, datacenters, and regions.</small></div>

        <div><small>With Kubernetes becoming the standard container orchestration tool, we got to a point in which apps are deployed and managed in the same ecosystem for different purposes. As a result, the number of Kubernetes distributions started to rise in order to deal with different scenarios. To name a few: OpenShift, RKE, Tanzu… K3s is one of the newest distributions made by Rancher, which is an open source project that recently joined the list of CNCF Sandbox projects. The main goal of K3s is providing a lightweight k8s distribution using a single binary, while reducing the memory consumed by the orchestration tool.In this lightning talk we will discuss what k3s is, compare it to k8s and see how it can be installed for different purposes: CI, Edge, development and production.</small></div>

Serverless cloud based applications bring new challenges with their architecture and scaling capabilities. In a perfect world, this should be an advantage only, but we all know by now, that the world ain’t perfect. Integrating serverless with non-serveless systems is a challenge you should take into account and plan accordingly.

        <h4 style="text-transform: uppercase;">When DevOps Fails, Miserably</h4>
        <div>IGNITE</div>
        <div><small>In this presentation I will briefly present some insights on the soft belly of DevOps. Even when SecDevOps is used, there are additional factors that should be understood for having a DevOps system or a DevOps operation secure. Some of the insights that I gain in the past years and most recently as the security manager of a major media company:
        <ul>
        <li>SecDevOps requires more people – security architects and security experts.</li>
        <li>Juniors will not cut it.</li>
        <li>Operational security experts will not do.</li>
        <li>Refer to OWASP IL by me: Should I Trust my Vendor</li>
        <li>Knowledge Gap – a very nefarious serial killer of DevOps, destroyer of security operations </li>
        <li>Ludicrous security tools – some tools are no good. In some ecosystems the best of breed tools is useless.</li>
        <li>Testbenching the 2 best of breed tools, mano-a-mano.</li>
        <li>Orientation on content and delivery </li></ul></small></div>

        <div>IGNITE</div>
        <div><small>Virtual talks are the new norm. In theory, they are great — speakers and attendees can join from around the world, infrastructure is cheap and scalable, recordings are simple. But what is happening in reality with problems like Zoom fatigue? What is and what isn’t working? At Elastic, we have done 400 virtual talks and meetups since March. This talk gives an overview of the development over time, specifics in regions, differences in tooling,… and adds some personal anecdotes.</small></div>

        <div>IGNITE</div>
        <div><small>One of the hardest parts professionally during this pandemic is how to shift a role that was mostly face-to-face and high travel to being 100% virtual - without losing the connection that in person interaction provides. This has led to a lot of growing pains over the past 8 months (!!!), but as a company cornerstoned in process we adapted our workflow to accommodate our New Abnormal. This is a 5 minute talk where I will run through how we shifted our workflow, not just by top loading already virtual content like blog posts but also focusing on other ways that the advocacy team could assist the business as a whole including shifting how to handle virtual events, booth duty, changes in how to present at virtual events, and more.</small></div>

        <div>IGNITE</div>
        <div><small>This talk will cover the similarities between observability of complex systems to humans, understanding and setting KPIs, alerts and why the CPU (working hours) is not necessarily the metric that measures how well an employee gives value. We’ll go through how engineering processes such as continuous integration, allowing us to catch problems earlier in smaller deltas, are not at all far from having a continuous improvement and feedback system. We’ll understand how a failed test in a build is a good thing, just as a human mistake or misbehaviour is in fact an opportunity to learn and improve.</small></div>

In this lighting talk I discuss the 3 data-driven burnout indicators I use to make sure my team rested and happy.  As a manager it’s your responsibility to identify employee burnout and make sure your dev team is rested and healthy. But identifying signs of burnout as a distributed team can be challenging.
